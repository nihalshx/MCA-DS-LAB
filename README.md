# MCA Data Structures Lab Program Repository â€“ MES College of Engineering, Kuttippuram

Welcome to the MCA Data Structures Lab Program repository! This repository contains a collection of data structures programs implemented in C language, designed for MCA (Master of Computer Applications) coursework. These programs focus on foundational data structure concepts and provide practical examples to enhance your understanding.

## Prerequisites

To run the programs, ensure you have the following:

- A code editor or IDE supporting C language (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks, Dev-C++)
- A C compiler like GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
